RF Explorer is a handheld Spectrum Analyzer targeting RF and Wireless enthusiast around the world working on ISM bands for digital communication. More info at http://www.rf-explorer.com .

This is the main entry point for hackers and advanced users looking for ways to extend RF Explorer or use it in new -creative- ways.

Some library licensing limitations prevent us from opening RF Explorer native firmware as open source, but the PC Client and other tools are full open source code for the community to extend and adapt to specific needs.

Take a look at the [wiki](http://code.google.com/p/rfexplorer/wiki/Welcome) for additional documentation, such as RS232 command interface specification or electric schematics.
